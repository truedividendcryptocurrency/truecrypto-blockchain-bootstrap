# truecrypto-blockchain-bootstrap

This repository contains bootstrap files for the TDC blockchain. Bootstrapping will usually reduce the amount of time it takes to sync the wallet since you don't need to download every block from networked peers. On a Core i5-4570 @ 3.2GHz running Windows, the time it took the wallet to sync dropped from over 2 hours to less than 50 minutes.

## Instructions

Place the <i>bootstrap.dat</i> file in your wallet data folder then launch the wallet.
